\section{Introduction}
This report documents the development of a system that can solve a sokoban challenge in a real world environment. The report consists of two parts, the first one concerns the construction of a robot able to traverse a sokoban field given the correct movement commands. The second part describes the development of a practical sokoban solver that is able to generate a command file for the robot, enabling it to solve the sokoban challenge.

\section{Robot description}
        The purpose of this prototype is to perform the assignment as described by
        the planner. In order to accomplish this task a robot 
        has been created. The robot is created using the LEGO NXT platform. 
        \begin{figure}[htp]
            \centering
    	    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{robot2}
	        \caption{Picture of the robot}\label{fig:robotPic}
        \end{figure} 
	\subsection{Physical Construction} %Morten  
	    \label{robot:physicalContruction}
	    The robot is constructed using two motors which applies force to
	    each of their front wheels, this allows the robot to steer using skid steering.
	    In front of the wheels two light sensors are placed to detect the line. Using
	    two sensors, in place of just one sensor, on top of the line allows for a wider
	    range of detection scenarios. If only one sensor was used the robot would be forced to follow one
	    of the edges of the line. Having two sensors allows for seeing the line
	    as in the middle (none of the sensors see's the line), slightly to the left (the left sensor see's the
	    line edge), far to the left (the left sensor see's the line), of course the same
	    goes for the other direction. Line edges can be detected
	    because the light sensors measure the amount of reflected light. 
	    When the area scanned by the sensor is partially covered by line, the sensors values also only changes partially. 
	    Having more than one sensor results in a larger coverage area and a higher detection resolution,
	    which allows for more fine grained control, and recovery of a larger misplacement of the robot.

	    In front of the two sensors, on the right side of the vehicle, another light sensor is placed.
	    This sensor is placed in front of the vehicle in order to detect crossing lines as early as possible, to allow
	    the vehicle to slow down, as it cannot stop instantly. The placement of the three optical sensors are as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:lightSensorPlacement}
	    \begin{figure}[htp]
            \centering
    	    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{lightSensorPlacement}
	        \caption{Illustration of light sensor placement, with the sensors mentioned S1-S3}\label{fig:lightSensorPlacement}
        \end{figure}	      
	\subsection{Robot architecture}
	    The software for the robot is implemented as a statemachine, which
	    interprets the commands given from the planner.
	    A statechart of the statemachine is shown in figure \ref{fig:RobotStateChart}
	    The states is described in the following.
	    \begin{figure}[htp]
            \centering
    	    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{TopLevelStateChart}
	        \caption{Statemachine of the Sokoban robot}\label{fig:RobotStateChart}
        \end{figure}
        \FloatBarrier
	    \subsubsection{Follow line}
	        The line following state has the responsibility of keeping the robot
		    constantly on the line using the sensors to allow for precise navigation.\\
		    \\
		    On figure \ref{fig:sensor_measurements}, a plot of what the sensors
		    measures when driving on a line is shown. It is clear when
		    looking at the plot that the signals do not contain a lot of higher
		    frequency components and will therefore not be improved much from being filtered,
		    it would however cause less phasemargin because of the filterdelay. 
		    These data was measured
		    doing a evaluation of a proportional feedback control system.
		    \\

    	        \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{sensor_measurements}
	            \caption{Raw samples of sensor measurements}\label{fig:sensor_measurements}
            \end{figure}
            \\
            
            \paragraph{Statemachine based}
            For making the control loop, two different implementations have been
            tested. One using a simple state machine based solution, where the
            state machine tries to assess the position of the line as either 
            in the middle (none of the sensors see's the line), slightly to the left (the left sensor see's the
	         line edge), far to the left (the left sensor see's the line)
	        then from this approximation of the relationship between
	        the line and the robot an action is performed by lowering the speed
	        on the wheel too close to the line according to the approximation.\\
            \\
            \paragraph{PD-feedback based}
            Another option which has been tested for the line following, is a PD control loop.
            The PD control loop has the advantage of potentially providing a much smoother and precise level of control, contrast the state machine based approach which is more jittery because it does not start correcting before reaching a threshold value.\\
            On figure \ref{fig:sensor_measurements} between sample 100 - 200,
            the sensed values can be seen during a correction using the PD-regulator.
            This causes the regulator to correct for the measured error 
            continuously, where the state machine based regulator, only corrects on state
            changes.
            \\
            Having implemented both solutions on the vehicle the control loop based
            solution was chosen as it had clearly the best performance. This
            was proven by allowing both algorithms to follow a 2m stretch of
            straight line for 100 runs and comparing the amount of errors of both algorithms.
            \\
            In this test the state machine based method failed in 13\% of the
            cases, where the PD regulator failed in only 2\% of the cases.

	    \subsubsection{Turn left and turn right}
	        The turn states makes the robot turn it's heading to
	        the right or the left,
	        it does this by using the tachometer for feedback.
	        To achieve the correct turning radius a combination of turning one
	        wheel forward while the other is turning backwards is used. This
	        can be seen from the example in listing \ref{code:turnleft}.
	        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Ruby, frame=single, basicstyle=\small, caption={TurnLeft Pseudo example}, label={code:turnleft}]
	        reset Tacho
	        until tachoCount > 1800 do:
	            TurnRightMotor Forward at 90% power
	            TurnLeftMotor Reverse at 30% power
	        return
	        \end{lstlisting}
	    \subsubsection{Turn around}
	        Turning the robot 180 degrees is more advanced than the simple turn left and right
	        states, because the precision requirements for this turn are
	        higher. It therefore consists of a number of steps which it must pass
	        through:
	        \begin{enumerate}
	            \item Back off to avoid hitting the jewel when turning
	            \item Turn $160^o$ around based on the tachometer
	            \item Turn until the frontmost sensor see a line
	            \item Turn the last bit using the tacho
	        \end{enumerate}
	        The amount of tachometer ticks needed to perform the remainder of the 180 degree revolution (from step 3 to step 4) is fairly constant, and is therefore implemented as a constant value.
	        This algorithm turns out to work accurately, but was first devised
	         towards the end of the project
	        and therefore comprehensive testing and tuning could not performed.
	    \subsubsection{Read command}
	        This state reads the next character from the text file and 
	        transitions to the next state.
	    \subsubsection{Next command}
	        This state interprets the command read, it just directs the call
	        to the correct action state, left, right, turn around etc., based on 
	        an internal variable containing the vehicle's heading.

	\subsection{Conclusion} %Morten
	    \label{robot:conclusion}
	   The completed vehicle was able to perform very well when going straight
	   and when performing turns in most cases, however turning immediately after a
	   180 degree turnaround proved to be very difficult, even though
	   the final position after the 180 degree turnaround varied very little.
       If time had permitted it this could be 
	   improved a lot by relying more on the optical sensors when performing the turn.
	   It is however noteworthy that the vehicle proved to be the fastest vehicle
	   at placing the first jewel in the competition, and during the competition for ten consecutive trials
	   performed without error until the first turn following a 180 degree turnaround, where it failed consequently.

\section{Conclusion and discussion}    
    The developed system is able to correctly calculate the optimal solution for solving
    the sokoban challenge, furthermore the robot is able to navigate the board in most
    aspects, however there is still some challenges remaining with a subset of the directional turning.
    In section \ref{robot:conclusion} a solution is proposed for solving this problem.\\
    \\
    The system was able to outperform the competitors during the competition in
    placing the first jewel, and up until the first time it had to perform,
    one the actions from the problematic subset of turning.
    This was due to a design decision of the robot, where the team aimed for 
    achieving the highest possible speed, at the cost of an increased risk of
    not completing the competition.
