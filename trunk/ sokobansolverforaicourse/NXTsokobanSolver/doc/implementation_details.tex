\subsection{Choice of programming language}
The first language considered for implementing the solver, was Python. Python however turned out to be very slow for this type of problem, in particular when using a debugger. We therefore turned to java, because java still provides a significant programming abstraction compared to C or C++, allowing us to focus more on the algorithms than on memory allocation and deallocation. Furthermore java has a standard library that is more mature and easier to use than the standard template library of C++.
